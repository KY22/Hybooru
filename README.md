[Hydrus](https://github.com/hydrusnetwork/hydrus)-based booru-styled imageboard in React, inspired by [hyve](https://github.com/imtbl/hyve).

Demo: https://booru.funmaker.moe/

[API Documentation](API.md)

[Changelog](CHANGELOG.md)

Hybooru allows you to create an online booru-styled imageboard and REST API on top of Hydrus client,
allowing you to access your collection from anywhere, without the need for running Hydrus instance.
It uses its own PostgreSQL database, populated using metadata from Hydrus' SQLite database.
Files are not cloned and instead served directly from Hydrus's database. You need to
regenerate the Hybooru's database every time you want to update it. Make sure to
properly configure `configs.json` file. **Stop Hydrus when you regenerate HyBooru's
database if you plan to use live Hydrus' database (use hydrus backup instead if
possible)**


## Features

- Searching by tags
- Negative search
- Ratings
- Sorting (date imported, rating, size, etc)
- Searching tags and autocomplete
- Notes and translation overlays
- tag and post relations (parents/siblings, duplicates/alternatives)
- Colored tags
- Blurhash
- REST API
- Mobile support
- OpenGraph and OpenSearch
- Supports browsers without JS

Minimum Hydrus Version: **v545**

Keep in mind this project is not a standalone, fully-fledged booru, but rather a read-only interface to your Hydrus database.
It does not provide any way to manage your posts or tags. The only way to add/modify your data is to do these
changes in Hydrus and then rebuild Hybooru's database again(can be done from the cog menu on search/post page).

Currently, only Hydrus Client database is supported. You cannot use Hybooru on top of Hydrus Server.


## Setup

1) Install NodeJS, npm and PostgreSQL.
2) Create new Postgresql database and user.
3) Allow user to use `pg_trgm` and `intarray` extensions. Either:
   - Grant the user permission to create trusted extensions: `GRANT CREATE ON DATABASE <database> TO <user>`.
   - Create the extensions yourself: `CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pg_trgm; CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS intarray;`.
4) Download latest [Release](https://github.com/funmaker/Hybooru/releases) production build [or build it yourself](#development).
5) Extract server files.
6) Edit `configs.json` to specify database credentials, hydrus db location and other options. See [Configuration](#configuration).
7) (Optional) Configure [reverse proxy](#reverse-proxy).
8) Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
9) Run `npm start` to start server.


## Searching Query Syntax

Searching tries to imitate classical booru's syntax. All tags are lowercase and use `_` instead of space character.
You can also use `?` to match for single character(eg: `?girl`) and `*` to match number of characters(eg: `blue_*`).
Patterns prefixed with `-` will be excluded from results. Patterns are matched against tag's name, but
Hydrus's `namespace:subtag` syntax is also supported.

Additionally you can sort results by including `order:*` in query. Supported sorts are: `order:posted`(date),
`order:id`, `order:rating`, `order:size`. You can also append `_desc` or `_asc` to specify order(eg: `order:posted_asc`).
If not specified, post are sorted by date descending.

If you use a numeric rating service and successfully imported the ratings, you can also filter posts by their ratings
using `rating:` namespace. You can search posts with specific rating(`rating:3`), range(`rating:2-4`) or query posts
that have not been rated(`rating:none`).

`system:` tags from Hydrus are not real tags and are not fully supported. Hybooru only supports `system:inbox`,
`system:archive` and a non-standard `system:trash` for filtering posts that are respectively in inbox, are not in inbox
and are in trash. You can use them in the blacklist/whitelist and you can also negate them using `-` prefix in searches.

Eg: `1girl blue_* -outdoors rating:3-5 order:rating_desc`


## Configuration

Hybooru's config is stored in `configs.json` file in the project's root directory. Restart Hybooru to apply changes.

You can also use `PORT` and `HOST` environmental variables to override `port` and `host` config values.

## Translation/overlay notes

_This feature is meant for advanced users._

Hydrus so far does not support overlay notes (https://github.com/hydrusnetwork/hydrus/issues/562). Hybooru implements it
using a non-standard extension to the existing Hydrus note system and custom content parser. If you want to display
overlay notes in Hybooru you will need to modify page parsers in Hydrus to create a note in special format that stores
note position and size. I have prepared few content parser for popular boorus:

<img src=".github/images/gelbooru.png" width="256"> <img src=".github/images/danbooru.png" width="256">

To import content parsers in Hydrus you need to go to network > downloader components > manage parsers > select target
file page parser > edit > content parsers and drag and drop one of the above images into the content parser list.
Hydrus will prevent you from dropping mismatched image into a different kind of list, but it will not prevent you from
adding a content parser to wrong page parse, so make sure you are adding it to the right page parser for the right
domain.

After importing content parser, newly imported images should have `translation` containing all the overlays if they have
any. However, Hydrus by default will not add translations to images that it already recognizes in the database. To
fetch overlay notes for images recognized by Hydrus, you will have to create a new Url Import tab (download > urls)
and go to import options > tags > set custom tag import options just for this importer > check both force fetch page
even if url/hash recognized and file already in db. In this particular importer hydrus will update notes(and other file
metadata I guess) even if it recognizes the image. You can also set it as the default, but it's not recommended.


### Overlay note format

[Content Parsers in Hydrus Documentation](https://hydrusnetwork.github.io/hydrus/downloader_parsers_content_parsers.html)

If you want to fetch overlays from different website, you will need to write your own content parser. Overlay notes
are stored in one or many regular hydrus notes and contain special commands that can be understood by Hybooru. One note
can contain any number of overlay sub-notes. The label/title of the note is ignored. The format is as follows:

```
<note content>
#! [<left>,<top>,<width>,<height>,<srcWidth>,<srcHeight>]

<note content>
#! [<left>,<top>,<width>,<height>,<srcWidth>,<srcHeight>]

...
```

For example:

```
Note in upper left corner
#! [50,50,100,100,500,500]

Multi
-line
note on the bottom
#! [0,400,500,100,500,500]
```

Sub-notes are divided using lines that begin with `#! `. On these lines Hybooru expects an JSON array with numbers
representing its position on the image. `<srcWidth>` and `<srcHeight>` represent the size of the original image. They
are necessary to keep overlays in the right in case an user copies notes to another version of the image, for example
in case of merge during duplicates processing. You can also set these values to `100` each if you are dealing with
positions in percents. It is strongly recommended you put all the subnotes into a single Hydrus note as the output
of your content parser. Hydrus uses note names to handle note update/replacement and outputting multiple notes with
generated names like `translation (###)` will make resolving conflicts much harder.


## Development

Build scripts are written for Linux. Building on Windows is currently not supported.
However, you can still look into `package.json` and change `scripts` to use Window's commands.
Alternatively you can probably just use Docker or a virtual machine.


### Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```


### Run development

```bash
npm run start
```


### Build production

```bash
npm run build:prod
```

Output is saved to `dist/` folder in project's root directory. These are the files you will want to deploy.


### Start production

```bash
cd dist
npm start
```


## Reverse Proxy

It is recommended to set up a reverse proxy to serve static files and enable HTTPS.

Example Nginx configuration:

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    listen 443 ssl;
    
    server_name booru.example.com;
    
    # Uncomment to override thumbnails location
    #location ~ ^\/files\/t(..)(.*)$ { 
    #    root /path/to/thumbnails;
    #    try_files /t$1/$1$2 =404;
    #}
    
    location ~ ^\/files\/(.)(..)(.*)$ {
        root /path/to/files; # hydrus's files location (eg: client_files folder inside hydrus's db folder)
        try_files /$1$2/$2$3 =404;
    }
    
    location / {
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
        
        proxy_pass http://localhost:3939/;
    }
}
```
